# Werewolf Generator

This is a very simple tool to generate roles and track player turns for the party game known as Werewolf.

A simple-as-pie tool for generating and keeping track of roles and kills in a typical game of Werewolf.
Add names of players, select number of roles, then let the tool do the rest.
Hover over roles for brief explanation. Click on players to toggle dead/alive state.

Quickly threw this together so I could host a game online, if you wanna suggest features or even contribute, please do!
